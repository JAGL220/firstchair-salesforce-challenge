Explanation of Approach:

For the declarative requirement, I implemented a Record-Triggered Flow on the Quote object that runs after save. The Flow checks whether the discount is greater than or equal to 15% and updates the Approval_Status__c field to “Pending Approval” only if the status is not already “Pending Approval” or “Approved.” I explicitly added the condition to exclude “Approved” because when approving a quote from the LWC, the Flow was reverting the status back to “Pending Approval” if the discount still met the threshold. This additional validation prevents conflicts between declarative automation and programmatic logic.

For the programmatic requirement, I created a bulkified Apex trigger on the Quote object that updates the related Opportunity’s Amount when a Quote changes to “Approved.” The trigger ensures that only the most recently approved Quote updates the Opportunity, preserving data integrity. Additionally, I developed a Lightning Web Component that displays pending Quotes assigned to the logged-in manager. The component uses a cacheable Apex method for data retrieval and an imperative Apex method for updates, ensuring good performance and scalability.
